# API
A metadata API is available to access more information about releases.

There is also a more extensive RESTful API generated by [Sails](http://sailsjs.org) for managing releases.
This private API is used by the Admin UI & is authenticated through LDAP by default, but you can customize this for your own use [without too much difficulty](deploy.md)!

#### List versions:
```
GET http://download.myapp.com/api/version
```

#### Get details about specific version:
```
GET http://download.myapp.com/api/version/1.1.0
```

#### List channels:
```
GET http://download.myapp.com/api/channel
```
